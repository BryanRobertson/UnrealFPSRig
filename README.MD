# Unreal FPS Animation Rig

My Blender files for creating First-Person shooter animations in Blender.
Sticking this on GitHub as a backup, so I can have some version history when I inevitably break it. 

I'm a gameplay programmer trying to teach myself a bit of FPS animation for fun, I have zero animation knowledge or ability, so I make no claim that this is at all useful for anyone other than me, or in any way good :)
